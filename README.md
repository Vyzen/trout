A small library of code for my own personal funsies.

Currently consists of three java trees:

Under Graph:

com.eigenvektor.graph -- A package for representing directed, weighted graphs.

com.eignevketor.tree -- A package for representing weighted n-ary trees.

Under Matrix:

com.eigenvektor.matrix -- A basic matrix manipulation package.
