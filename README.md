A small library of code for my own personal funsies.

Currently consists of four java trees:

+ com.eigenvektor.graph -- A package for representing directed, weighted graphs.
+ com.eignevketor.tree -- A package for representing weighted n-ary trees.
+ com.eigenvektor.matrix -- A basic matrix manipulation package.
+ com.eigenvektor.amq -- An approximate membership query package including a Bloom filter and a quotient filter.

And three Scala trees:

+com.eigenvektor.amq -- Wrappers and implicits for the Java amq package.
+com.eigenvektor.matrix -- Wrappers and implicits for the Java matrix package.
+com.eigenvektor.priorityqueue -- A native Scala fully-persistent priority queue implementation.
